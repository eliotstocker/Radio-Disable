Radio-Disable
=============
![App Icon](512.png)

Description
-----------
An android app to disable the mobile network on your device when you are connected to selected mobile networks.
This can save a large amount of battery when on low to no signal areas, If like me you use WiFi Calling this allows the battery drain to be removed without losing the ability to call.

Support
-------
4.0 - 4.4
Working on 5.0 Support, hoever the current implementation wont work on 5.0 due to some class differences.

I will be submitting to the app store in the comming days.
